â€‹	Federico Bond, Franco Amat and Gonzalo Blousson^[1]^ (2015) proposed a solution to simplify the verification of academic certificates and prevent academic certificate fraud. The solution is using the digital signature scheme and timestamps used in blockchain technology. Federico, Franco and Gonzalo explain that the authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of digital academic certificates are ensured by the digital signature scheme, and the internal fraud is prevent by timestamp. Yuqin Xu, Shangli Zhao, Lanju Kong, Yongqing Zheng and Shidong Zhang(2017) presents educational certificate blockchain(ECBC). ECBC uses MPT tree to speed up query for transaction, and using cooperation of peers to reduce the latency^[2]^. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology cooperate with Central New Mexico Community College(2017) and try to support the digital academic certificates through an application based on blockchain. They publish a digital academic certification open source standard called Blockcerts^[3]^. Jiin-Chiou Cheng, Narn-Yih Lee, Chien Chi, and Yi-Hua Chen(2018)  designed a digital certificate system based on Ethereum blockchain. They use the smart contract of Ethereum to expand the scope of application, and support solidity language to improve the efficiency function at each stage^[4]^.
